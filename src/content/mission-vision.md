## Description

Pathways, a 2-day data science career workshop for students, faculty, and staff to engage with a wide range of early-career development activities and presentations geared toward incubating a conversation around student needs and wants, while faculty, staff, and administrators engaging with those students are equally empowered to better support their own programs.

## Background

More and more research is being done by teams of people spread across multiple organizations. In addition these teams are working with larger quantities of data that need to be shared and maintained. Advances in cloud computing has created advantages to working with data in a cloud environment as opposed to data stored on site and copied or accessed remotely. 

 The use of data storage and compute in the cloud provides advantages to large, multi-institutional projects but is not easy to initiate.  The effective management and movement of data to and in the cloud involves a number of considerations including cost, change management, security, daa management and the data life cycle.
